# Password Generator (Vite + React)

## Overview

This is a small password generator app built with React and Vite. It generates random passwords with configurable length and options to include numbers and special characters. The UI uses utility classes (Tailwind-style), but Tailwind is optional — the app will still function without it.

## Features

- Generate random passwords
- Set password length with a range input
- Toggle inclusion of numbers and special characters
- Copy password to clipboard

## Files of interest

- `src/App.jsx` — main application component (password generation logic and UI)
- `src/main.jsx` — React entry file, mounts the app to `<div id="root"></div>` in `index.html`
- `index.html` — Vite HTML template
- `package.json` — scripts and dependencies (Vite + React)

## Run locally (Windows PowerShell)

1. Open PowerShell and change to the project folder:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\tutedude\REACTJS\passwordgenrator"
```

2. Install dependencies (if you haven't already):

```powershell
npm install
```

3. Start the dev server:

```powershell
npm run dev
```

4. Open the URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

## Troubleshooting

- If the page is blank, open DevTools (F12) and check the Console for runtime errors. Common issues include typos (e.g., `Math` vs `math`) that throw and prevent render.
- If styling from Tailwind isn't applied, ensure Tailwind is configured. The app will still function without Tailwind; only styles may differ.

## Add this project to GitHub (step-by-step, PowerShell)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (via the website). Copy the repository URL (HTTPS)

2. In PowerShell, from the project root, run:

```powershell
# Initialize git if needed
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - password generator"

# Add remote (replace <your-repo-url> with the HTTPS URL you copied)
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git

# Push to GitHub (main branch). If your local branch is 'master' adjust accordingly.
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

> Notes:
> - If you use SSH instead of HTTPS, use your SSH remote URL when adding `origin`.
> - If you get an authentication error when pushing, follow GitHub's guidance to setup PAT (Personal Access Token) or SSH keys.

## Optional improvements

- Add an ErrorBoundary to avoid full-blank pages on runtime errors.
- Add unit tests for the generator logic.
- Add a small CI action (GitHub Actions) to run lint/tests on push.

If you want, I can:

- Start the dev server here and paste the terminal output and any browser console messages.
- Create a `.gitignore` (node_modules, dist) and commit the README and .gitignore for you.
- Walk through pushing to GitHub interactively and run the commands from this environment.
